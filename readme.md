# TodoAppWithBackboneRequireAndMVC

#### The Backbone Todo app implemented with MVC3 and using require.js


## Introduction

I started looking into Backbone and how to use it with MVC by looking at this excellent tutorial by Diego: [ASP.NET MVC3 RESTful application tutorial with Backbone.js](http://www.bitcandies.com/blog/2011/asp-net-mvc3-restful-application-tutorial-with-backbone-js-part-i/).

I had been reading about require.js and about splitting the Backbone files up into the recommended layout of folders. So, I've extended the tutorial code to include require.js for loading all the parts required to run the app.
