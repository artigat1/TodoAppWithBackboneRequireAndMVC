# TodoAppWithBackboneRequireAndMVC

#### The Backbone Todo app implemented with MVC3 and using require.js


## Introduction

I followed the excellent tutorial by Diego for creating an MVC3 RESTful app [ASP.NET MVC3 RESTful application tutorial with Backbone.js](http://www.bitcandies.com/blog/2011/asp-net-mvc3-restful-application-tutorial-with-backbone-js-part-i/).

I had been reading about require.js and about splitting the Backbone files up into the recommended layout of folders. So, I've extended the tutorial code to include require.js for loading all the parts required to run the app.
